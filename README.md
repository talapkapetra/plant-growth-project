# 1. Plant Growth Project


## Objective

"Plant Growth Data Classification" dataset was used for this project. The aim was to compare different conditions, environment and management factors to predict reaching the milestone of growth of a plant type (The species of that is unknown.)

### The following conditions and factors have been investigated:

- Soil_Type: The type or composition of soil in which the plants are grown.
- Sunlight_Hours: The duration or intensity of sunlight exposure received by the plants.
- Fertilizer_Type: The type of fertilizer used for nourishing the plants.
- Temperature: The ambient temperature conditions under which the plants are grown. 
- Humidity: The level of moisture or humidity in the environment surrounding the plants.
- Growth_Milestone: Descriptions or markers indicating stages or significant events in the growth process of the plants (1: reached in the time period of the experiment; 0: not reached in the time period of the experiment)

I used Python to perform data analysis (plant_growth_project.ipynb).

I created a Tableau presentation to visualize the graphs and results (https://talapkapetra.github.io/portfolio/plant_growth_project_tableau_public.html).

# 2. Olympic

## Objective

I used a detailed dataset to compare the performances of Countries in Olympic Games in the time period: 1896-2012.

I mainly focused on the number of Medals awarded. 

I created data visualization in Tableau, I made two dashboards
- World: Contains all data worldwide.
- Hungary: I filtered dataset to Hungary.
